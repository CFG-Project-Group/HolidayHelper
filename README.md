Holiday Helper
</h1>

This app will help you find your way around a new place you’re visiting! Starting slowly with just 4 cities (Barcelona, Budapest, London and Prague) but looking to the future with expansion vision for any place you're dreaming of!
To use the app you have to register, but then you’ll free to roam around. You can check the area on the map, look for nearby attractions and current weather, you can check what events are happening in the next few days or check how to say ‘Hello’ in native language! And if you’re planning to shop around you can always check how much it is in your currency so you don’t have to worry about spending over your limit. Who knew Kč285 is around £10?!
